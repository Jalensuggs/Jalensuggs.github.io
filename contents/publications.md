During the development of this project, I worked with team members on the design and arrangement of the framework. During the implementation process, I used reflection and underlying multi-threaded Thread technology. For the web page rendering part, I used CSS, JavaScript and HTML5, and used the Vue framework for rendering. Taking into account Vue's non-polymorphism, we also designed the Vue 2.0 version.  In order to ensure the maintainability of the backend, I adopted the MVC three-tier architecture. In addition, in order to implement persistence operations, I introduced the MyBatis framework. By using MyBatis, I can add, delete, modify, and query data, further improving the functionality of the project.
